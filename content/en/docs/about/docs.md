Welcome to the Portefaix documentation!

## Introduction

The Portefaix docs are published at [portefaix.xyz](https://portefaix.xyz/).

The source for the docs is in the
[nlamirault/portefaix repo](https://github.com/nlamirault/portefaix/) on GitHub.
We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, and
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site.

## Versioning

[portefaix.xyz](https://portefaix.xyz/) points to the **master** branch of the docs. You can access
other versions by clicking the version dropdown at top right of the website
menu bar.
